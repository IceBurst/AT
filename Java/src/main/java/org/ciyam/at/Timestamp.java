/**
 * CIYAM-AT "Timestamp"
 * <p>
 * With CIYAM-ATs, "timestamp" does not mean a real timestamp but instead is an artificial timestamp that includes three parts:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>block height (32 bits)</li>
 * <li>blockchain ID (8 bits)</li>
 * <li>intra-block transaction sequence (24 bits)</li>
 * </ul>
 * This allows up to 256 different blockchains and up to ~16million transactions per block.
 * <p>
 * A blockchain ID of zero is assumed to be the 'native' blockchain.
 * <p>
 * Timestamp values are not directly manipulated by AT OpCodes so endianness isn't important here.
 * 
 * @see Timestamp#Timestamp(int, int, int)
 * @see Timestamp#Timestamp(long)
 * @see Timestamp#longValue()
 * @see Timestamp#toLong(int, int, int)
