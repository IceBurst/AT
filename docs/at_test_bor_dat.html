Test for AT instruction code 0x0a (BOR_DAT)
-------------------------------------------

For each test the assembly and machine code are listed as is the data dump or expected error if test case has
been created specifically to fail (with a data dump if any data was expected to have changed before the error
occurred).

A summary of the tests follows:

Test 1 - Check some basic usage.
Test 2 - Check highest value works.
Test 3 - Check full address range.
Test 4 - Check overwriting works.
Test 5 - Check address range edge fail.
Test 6 - Check negative adddress fails.
