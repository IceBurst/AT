Test for AT instruction code 0x13 (RET_SUB)
-------------------------------------------

For each test the assembly and machine code are listed as is the data dump or expected error if test case has
been created specifically to fail (with a data dump if any data was expected to have changed before the error
occurred).

A summary of the tests follows:
Test 1 - Check some basic usage.
Test 2 - Multiple RETs
Test 3 - RET without JMP.
Test 4 - 2-RET 1-JMP
