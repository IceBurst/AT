Test for AT instruction code 0x20 (BLT_DAT)
-------------------------------------------

For each test the assembly and machine code are listed as is the data dump or expected error if test case has
been created specifically to fail (with a data dump if any data was expected to have changed before the error
occurred).

A summary of the tests follows:

Test 1 - Check some basic usage.
Test 2 - Jump forwards and backwords.
Test 3 - Jump to out range address.
Test 4 - Jump to invalid address.
Test 5 - Infinite loop.
