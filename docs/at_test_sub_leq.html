Test for AT instruction code 0x25 (SUB_LEQ)
-------------------------------------------

For each test the assembly and machine code are listed as is the data dump or expected error if test case has
been created specifically to fail (with a data dump if any data was expected to have changed before the error
occurred).

A summary of the tests follows:

Test 1 - Basic usage (1).
Test 2 - Basic usage (2).
Test 3 - Invalid address.
Test 4 - Out of range address.
