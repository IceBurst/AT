Test for AT instruction code 0x28 (FIN_IMD)
-------------------------------------------

For each test the assembly and machine code are listed as is the data dump or expected error if test case has
been created specifically to fail (with a data dump if any data was expected to have changed before the error
occurred).

A summary of the tests follows:

Test 1 - Check it stops.
Test 2 - FIN_IMD first command.
