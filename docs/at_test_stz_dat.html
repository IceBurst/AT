Test for AT instruction code 0x27 (STZ_DAT)
-------------------------------------------

For each test the assembly and machine code are listed as is the data dump or expected error if test case has
been created specifically to fail (with a data dump if any data was expected to have changed before the error
occurred).

A summary of the tests follows:

Test 1 - Basic usage.
Test 2 - Jump to not existing address.
