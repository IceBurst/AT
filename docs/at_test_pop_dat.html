Test for AT instruction code 0x11 (POP_DAT)
-------------------------------------------

For each test the assembly and machine code are listed as is the data dump or expected error if test case has
been created specifically to fail (with a data dump if any data was expected to have changed before the error
occurred).

A summary of the tests follows:
Test 1 - Check some basic usage.
Test 2 - Check address range.
Test 3 - POP without PSH first
Test 4 - POP to address out of range
