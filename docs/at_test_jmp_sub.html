Test for AT instruction code 0x12 (JMP_SUB)
-------------------------------------------

For each test the assembly and machine code are listed as is the data dump or expected error if test case has
been created specifically to fail (with a data dump if any data was expected to have changed before the error
occurred).

A summary of the tests follows:
Test 1 - Check some basic usage.
Test 2 - Check some basic usage (using ret).
Test 3 - Jump to not valid address point
Test 4 - infinite loop
